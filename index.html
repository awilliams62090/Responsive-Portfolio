            <img id="bio-pic" src="assets\images\AW-38.jpg" alt="Alyssa">

            <p>Hello! Thank you for stopping by my page. As an almost native to Colorado (been here since I was a mere 6 weeks
                old), I enjoy living in the 4 seasons we have. I left for a few years in 2008-2009 to try my luck in Vegas
                (didn't work out as I had planned) and then again from 2012-2015 to pursue a career down in Southern Utah
                at Lake Powell. I have to say I have had some great adventures in my early twenties and am excited to see
                what my late twenties and beyond brings me! I currently work in the wedding and events industry behind the
                scenes in administration/human resources. I am always looking to develop my career and expand my network
                base as well as my own personal brain power, which is what has landed me in the DU Bootcamp program!</p>

            <p>When I am not learning, you can find me in the kitchen, crafting new recipes and dazzling people with my amature
                chef skills. I also enjoy music, movies, enjoying all that Colorado has to offer, and of course, spending
                as much time as I can with my pup, Malibu. She is my partner in crime and we compliment each other's crazy,
                sometimes a little too well I think!
            </p>
